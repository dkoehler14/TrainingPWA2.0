# Supabase Migration Status

## Task 1: Set up Supabase project and development environment ✅ COMPLETED

### What was accomplished:

#### 1. Supabase Client Configuration
- ✅ Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency
- ✅ Created `src/config/supabase.js` with proper client configuration
- ✅ Added development logging and configuration validation

#### 2. Environment Variables Setup
- ✅ Updated `.env`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production` with Supabase configuration
- ✅ Preserved existing Firebase configuration (marked as legacy)
- ✅ Configured local development URLs and keys

#### 3. Database Schema and Migrations
- ✅ Created initial schema migration (`20240101000000_initial_schema.sql`)
- ✅ Created performance indexes migration (`20240101000001_create_indexes.sql`)
- ✅ Created Row Level Security policies (`20240101000002_row_level_security.sql`)
- ✅ Created authentication triggers (`20240101000003_auth_triggers.sql`)
- ✅ Created seed data for development (`supabase/seed.sql`)

#### 4. Development Scripts and Tools
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with Supabase development scripts
- ✅ Created comprehensive setup helper (`scripts/supabase-dev-setup.js`)
- ✅ Created setup verification script (`scripts/verify-supabase-setup.js`)
- ✅ Updated main dev script to use Supabase instead of Firebase

#### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created detailed setup guide (`docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`)
- ✅ Documented all service URLs, scripts, and troubleshooting

### Available Scripts:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev                 # Start React + Supabase
npm run dev:supabase       # Start only Supabase

# Supabase Management
npm run supabase:start     # Start Supabase services
npm run supabase:stop      # Stop Supabase services
npm run supabase:status    # Check service status
npm run supabase:reset     # Reset database
npm run supabase:studio    # Open database UI
npm run supabase:types     # Generate TypeScript types

# Setup and Verification
npm run supabase:setup     # Complete setup
npm run verify:supabase    # Verify configuration
```

### Database Schema Created:
- `users` - User profiles with Supabase Auth integration
- `exercises` - Exercise definitions (global and user-specific)
- `programs` - Workout programs
- `program_workouts` - Individual workouts within programs
- `program_exercises` - Exercises within workouts
- `workout_logs` - Completed workout sessions
- `workout_log_exercises` - Exercise data from workouts
- `user_analytics` - User performance analytics

### Security Features:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User-specific data access policies
- Automatic user profile creation via auth triggers
- Secure authentication flow with Supabase Auth

### Prerequisites for Next Steps:
1. **Docker Desktop** must be installed and running
2. Run `npm run supabase:start` to initialize local database
3. Verify setup with `npm run verify:supabase`

### Verification Results:
- ✅ 14/15 checks passed
- ❌ 1 check failed (Docker not installed - system requirement)

The Supabase development environment is fully configured and ready for the next migration tasks. All database schema, authentication, security policies, and development tools are in place.

### Next Task Ready:
Task 2.1: Create core user and authentication tables (database schema is already created, ready for testing and refinement)
