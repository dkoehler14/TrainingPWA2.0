### Migration Timeline
- **Preparation Phase**: 2-3 days
- **Initial Migration**: 4-6 hours (off-peak)
- **Traffic Switching**: 2-4 hours (monitored)
- **Verification**: 24-48 hours (continuous monitoring)
- **Cleanup**: 1-2 days

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Blue-Green Deployment Approach

┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   BLUE (OLD)    │    │  GREEN (NEW)    │
│                 │    │                 │
│   Firebase      │    │   Supabase      │
│   Firestore     │    │   PostgreSQL    │
│   Functions     │    │   Edge Functions│
