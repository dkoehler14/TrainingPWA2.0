### 2. Test Runner Script (`scripts/run-user-acceptance-tests.js`)

Developed a comprehensive test runner that:
- Validates prerequisites (Node.js, Supabase CLI, environment variables)
- Sets up test environment automatically
- Runs user acceptance tests with proper configuration
- Generates detailed reports
- Validates acceptance criteria
- Handles cleanup and error recovery

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Implemented comprehensive performance tracking:
- **Performance Thresholds**: All operations must complete within 2 seconds
- **Tracked Categories**: Authentication, data operations, UI operations
- **Metrics Collection**: Duration, operation type, timestamp
- **Automatic Validation**: Performance assertions in each test

### 4. Documentation (`docs/user-acceptance-testing.md`)

Created comprehensive documentation covering:
- Test scenarios and workflows
- Performance requirements and thresholds
- Setup and execution instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- CI/CD integration examples
- Best practices and maintenance

### 5. Package Scripts

Added convenient npm scripts:
- `npm run test:user-acceptance` - Run user acceptance tests
- `npm run test:user-acceptance:ci` - Run in CI mode
- `npm run test:uat` - Shorthand for user acceptance tests
- `npm run test:uat:ci` - Shorthand for CI mode
