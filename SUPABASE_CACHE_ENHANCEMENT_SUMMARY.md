# Supabase Cache Enhancement Summary

## Problem
The `supabaseCache.js` was only fetching basic program data from the `programs` table, but the `Programs.js` component expects programs to have complete workout data including `program_workouts`, `program_exercises`, and transformed `weekly_configs`.

## Solution
Enhanced the cache system to fetch and cache complete program data with all related tables and transformations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Import for Data Transformation
```javascript
import { transformSupabaseProgramToWeeklyConfigs } from '../utils/dataTransformations'
```

### 2. Added Helper Functions
- `fetchAndTransformPrograms(query)` - Fetches program data and applies transformations
- `createCompleteProgramQuery(baseQuery)` - Creates the complete SELECT query with all related tables

### 3. Enhanced Cache Warming Functions

#### `warmUserCache(userId, priority)`
- Now fetches complete program structure with `user_programs_all_${userId}` cache key
- Includes both user programs and template programs in a single query
- Fetches user-specific exercises (both global and user-created)
- Transforms program data to include `weekly_configs`

#### `warmAppCache()`
- Warms template programs with complete structure
- Uses the same transformation pipeline

#### `warmUserCacheIntelligent(userId, userActivity)`
- Updated to use complete program structure
- Uses unified cache key approach

### 4. Added New Utility Functions

#### `getAvailableExercisesCached(userId)`
- Fetches both global and user-created exercises
- Matches the pattern expected by Programs.js component

#### `getAllUserProgramsCached(userId)`
- Fetches all programs for a user with complete structure
- Uses unified cache approach with proper transformations

### 5. Complete Program Query Structure
The enhanced cache now fetches:
```sql
SELECT *,
program_workouts (
  *,
  program_exercises (
    *,
    exercises (
      id,
      name,
      primary_muscle_group,
      exercise_type,
      instructions
    )
  )
)
FROM programs
```

### 6. Data Transformation Pipeline
1. Fetch complete program data from database
2. Sort workouts by week_number and day_number
3. Sort exercises within workouts by order_index
4. Transform using `transformSupabaseProgramToWeeklyConfigs()`
5. Cache the transformed data

## Benefits
1. **Complete Data**: Cache now contains all necessary program data
2. **Performance**: Reduces database queries by caching transformed data
3. **Consistency**: Uses same transformation logic as programService.js
4. **Unified Approach**: Single cache key for all program data per user
5. **Error Prevention**: Programs.js will no longer encounter missing `weekly_configs`

## Cache Keys Used
- `user_programs_all_${userId}` - All programs for a user (unified approach)
- `exercises_user_${userId}` - All available exercises for a user
- `template_programs_all` - All template programs
- `exercises_global_all` - All global exercises

## Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing cache invalidation functions
- Works with existing Programs.js component expectations
- Integrates with existing performance monitoring and debugging systems
