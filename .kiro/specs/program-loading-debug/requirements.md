# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LogWorkout page is experiencing an issue where programs are being fetched successfully from the database (as shown in console logs with `programCount: 2`) but are not appearing on the page. The cache layer shows `documentCount: 0` and `programCount: 0`, indicating a disconnect between the database fetch and the data transformation/caching process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my programs listed in the LogWorkout page so that I can select and log workouts for them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the LogWorkout page THEN the system SHALL fetch their active programs from the database
2. WHEN programs are successfully fetched from the database THEN the system SHALL properly transform and cache the data
3. WHEN programs are transformed and cached THEN the system SHALL display them in the program selection dropdown
4. WHEN the cache shows different counts than the database fetch THEN the system SHALL log detailed debugging information to identify the discrepancy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed debugging information about the program loading process so that I can identify where data is being lost in the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN programs are fetched from the database THEN the system SHALL log the raw data structure
2. WHEN data transformation occurs THEN the system SHALL log before and after states
3. WHEN caching occurs THEN the system SHALL log the exact data being cached and its structure
4. WHEN there's a mismatch between database and cache counts THEN the system SHALL log detailed comparison information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the program loading to be reliable and consistent so that I can always access my workout programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database returns programs THEN the UI SHALL always display those programs
2. WHEN there are data transformation errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle them and still display available data
3. WHEN caching fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to direct database queries
4. WHEN programs fail to load THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message to the user
