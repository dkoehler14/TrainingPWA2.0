# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add comprehensive debug logging to data transformation pipeline
  - Add detailed logging to `transformSupabaseProgramToWeeklyConfigs` function
  - Log raw input data, intermediate transformations, and final output
  - Add data structure validation at each step
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Enhance cache operation logging

  - Add detailed logging to cache set/get operations in `supabaseCache`
  - Log the exact data being cached and retrieved
  - Add data size and structure validation in cache operations
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Add data validation checks in program service

  - Add validation in `getAllUserPrograms` before and after transformation
  - Log data counts and structure at key points
  - Add error handling for malformed data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Implement fallback mechanisms for program loading

  - Add try-catch blocks around data transformation
  - Implement fallback to raw data if transformation fails
  - Ensure UI always receives displayable program data
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Add temporary debugging to LogWorkout component


  - Log the exact data received from `getUserPrograms`
  - Add logging before and after `ensureBackwardCompatibility`
  - Log the final programs array that gets set in state
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1_

- [x] 6. Test and verify the fix
  - Run the application and check console logs
  - Verify programs appear in the UI
  - Confirm cache operations work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 7. Clean up debug logging (optional)
  - Remove or reduce verbose debug logging once issue is resolved
  - Keep essential error handling and validation
  - Document the root cause and solution
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
