# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish a comprehensive local development environment for the React Firebase application, enabling developers to test changes locally without requiring deployment to Firebase hosting. The solution will include local development servers, Firebase emulators, and hot-reloading capabilities to significantly improve development velocity and testing efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the React application locally with hot-reloading, so that I can see changes immediately without rebuilding or deploying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs a local development command THEN the React application SHALL start on a local port with hot-reloading enabled
2. WHEN a developer modifies React components or styles THEN the browser SHALL automatically refresh to show changes within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a developer saves a file THEN the application SHALL rebuild automatically without manual intervention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run Firebase Functions locally, so that I can test backend functionality without deploying to the cloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer starts the Firebase emulator suite THEN Firebase Functions SHALL run locally and be accessible via HTTP endpoints
2. WHEN a developer modifies function code THEN the functions SHALL reload automatically without restarting the entire emulator
3. WHEN the React app makes API calls THEN it SHALL connect to local Firebase Functions instead of production endpoints during development

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Firebase Firestore emulator locally, so that I can test database operations without affecting production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer starts the Firestore emulator THEN a local Firestore instance SHALL be available for testing
2. WHEN the React application performs database operations THEN it SHALL connect to the local Firestore emulator during development
3. WHEN a developer restarts the emulator THEN the local database state SHALL persist or be easily reset as needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Firebase Authentication emulator, so that I can test user authentication flows locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer starts the Authentication emulator THEN local user authentication SHALL be available
2. WHEN a user attempts to sign in during local development THEN the authentication SHALL work against the local emulator
3. WHEN a developer creates test users THEN they SHALL persist in the local emulator for the session

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified development startup command, so that I can start all necessary services with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the development startup command THEN all required services SHALL start concurrently (React dev server, Firebase emulators)
2. WHEN all services are running THEN the developer SHALL receive clear console output indicating which services are running on which ports
3. WHEN any service fails to start THEN the developer SHALL receive clear error messages indicating what went wrong

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configuration, so that the application automatically connects to local services during development and production services when deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN it SHALL automatically connect to local Firebase emulators
2. WHEN the application runs in production mode THEN it SHALL connect to production Firebase services
3. WHEN switching between environments THEN no manual configuration changes SHALL be required by the developer

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want debugging capabilities in the local environment, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running locally THEN the React application SHALL provide detailed error messages and stack traces
2. WHEN Firebase Functions encounter errors locally THEN detailed error logs SHALL be visible in the console
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN source maps SHALL be available for both frontend and backend code
