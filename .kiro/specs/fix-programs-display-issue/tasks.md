# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create data transformation utility function
  - Create `transformSupabaseProgramToWeeklyConfigs` function in `src/utils/dataTransformations.js`
  - Handle conversion from normalized database structure to weekly_configs format
  - Include proper error handling for malformed or missing data
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.2, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Add unit tests for data transformation
  - Write comprehensive tests for the transformation function
  - Test various input scenarios including edge cases
  - Test error handling for invalid data structures
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Enhance getUserPrograms service function
  - Modify `getUserPrograms` in `src/services/programService.js` to fetch related workout and exercise data
  - Use Supabase joins to get program_workouts and program_exercises in a single query
  - Apply the data transformation to convert to expected format
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Update program service to maintain caching compatibility
  - Ensure the enhanced query works with existing caching mechanisms
  - Update cache keys if necessary to account for additional data
  - Test that cache invalidation still works correctly
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Create sample workout data for seeding
  - Define realistic workout structures for beginner, intermediate, and test users
  - Include proper exercise assignments with sets, reps, and progression
  - Ensure data uses existing global exercises from the exercise library
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 6. Update seeding script to create programs for all users
  - Modify `scripts/seed/supabase/seeder.js` to create programs for all test users
  - Use `createCompleteProgram` function to create programs with proper normalized structure
  - Include program_workouts and program_exercises data for each program
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 7. Add error handling to Programs page component
  - Update `src/pages/Programs.js` to handle programs with missing weekly_configs gracefully
  - Add appropriate messaging for programs without workout data
  - Ensure the page doesn't crash when parseWeeklyConfigs receives invalid data
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3_

- [ ] 8. Test the complete solution
  - Run the updated seeding script to create test data
  - Verify that all test users (including beginner user) have programs
  - Test that the Programs page displays correctly for all user types
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 9. Verify program details functionality
  - Test that program details modal works with the transformed data
  - Verify that performance metrics display correctly
  - Ensure workout logs integration still functions properly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 10. Add logging and debugging support
  - Add console.log statements to help debug data transformation issues
  - Include error logging for transformation failures
  - Add debugging information for cache hits/misses with new data structure
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 4.2_
