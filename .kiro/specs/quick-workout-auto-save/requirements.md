# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement automatic saving functionality for the Quick Workout page, similar to the debounced save system already implemented in LogWorkout.js. Currently, users must manually save their quick workouts, which can lead to data loss if they accidentally navigate away or close the browser. By implementing auto-save, we'll provide a seamless experience where workout data is automatically preserved as users make changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating a quick workout, I want my workout data to be automatically saved as I make changes, so that I don't lose my progress if I accidentally navigate away or close the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user modifies any workout data (reps, weights, sets, notes, bodyweight) THEN the system SHALL automatically save the changes after a 1-second delay
2. WHEN a user adds or removes exercises THEN the system SHALL automatically save the updated exercise list
3. WHEN a user changes the workout name THEN the system SHALL automatically save the new name
4. WHEN multiple rapid changes are made THEN the system SHALL debounce the save operations to prevent excessive database writes
5. WHEN auto-save occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to indicate the save status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my draft workout to be restored when I return to the page, so that I can continue where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates away from the quick workout page with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL preserve the draft workout
2. WHEN a user returns to the quick workout page THEN the system SHALL restore any existing draft workout
3. WHEN a user completes and saves a workout THEN the system SHALL clear the draft data
4. WHEN a user explicitly clears the workout THEN the system SHALL remove the draft data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the auto-save functionality to work efficiently without impacting performance, so that my workout logging experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-save is triggered THEN the system SHALL use the same debounced approach as LogWorkout.js with a 1-second delay
2. WHEN multiple fields are changed rapidly THEN the system SHALL batch the changes into a single save operation
3. WHEN auto-save occurs THEN the system SHALL not block the user interface
4. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL clean up any pending save operations
