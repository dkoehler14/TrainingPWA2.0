# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide automated test data seeding capabilities for the local development environment, enabling developers to quickly populate Firebase emulators with realistic test users, workout programs, and exercises. This will streamline testing of workout logging functionality and other user-dependent features without requiring manual data entry for each development session.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically create test users with authentication credentials, so that I can test user-specific functionality without manually creating accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the test data seeding command THEN test users SHALL be created in the Firebase Auth emulator with predefined email/password combinations
2. WHEN test users are created THEN they SHALL have realistic user profiles with names, preferences, and account settings
3. WHEN the seeding process completes THEN the developer SHALL receive confirmation of created user accounts with their credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test users to have pre-configured workout programs, so that I can test workout logging and program management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test users are created THEN they SHALL have associated workout programs with realistic names and structures
2. WHEN workout programs are created THEN they SHALL include multiple workout days with different exercise combinations
3. WHEN programs are seeded THEN they SHALL follow realistic workout programming patterns (push/pull/legs, upper/lower, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive exercise database seeded in the emulator, so that workout programs can reference real exercises with proper metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the seeding process runs THEN a comprehensive set of exercises SHALL be created in Firestore with proper categorization
2. WHEN exercises are created THEN they SHALL include muscle groups, equipment requirements, and exercise instructions
3. WHEN exercises are seeded THEN they SHALL cover major movement patterns (squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, rows, etc.)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test workout logs and progress data, so that I can test progress tracking and analytics features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test users are created THEN they SHALL have historical workout logs spanning several weeks
2. WHEN workout logs are created THEN they SHALL include realistic weight progressions and rep/set combinations
3. WHEN progress data is seeded THEN it SHALL demonstrate various training scenarios (beginner progression, plateaus, deloads)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple command to seed all test data, so that I can quickly set up a complete testing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the seed command THEN all test data SHALL be created in the correct sequence (exercises, users, programs, logs)
2. WHEN the seeding process runs THEN it SHALL provide progress feedback and completion status
3. WHEN seeding fails THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate what went wrong and how to resolve it

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ability to reset test data, so that I can start with a clean slate for different testing scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs the reset command THEN all test data SHALL be removed from the emulators
2. WHEN data is reset THEN the developer SHALL receive confirmation of the cleanup process
3. WHEN reset is complete THEN the emulators SHALL be in a clean state ready for fresh data seeding

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want different test data scenarios, so that I can test various user states and edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN seeding test data THEN multiple user scenarios SHALL be available (new user, experienced user, user with injuries/limitations)
2. WHEN different scenarios are seeded THEN they SHALL represent realistic user journeys and data patterns
3. WHEN scenario-specific data is created THEN it SHALL be clearly documented for testing purposes
