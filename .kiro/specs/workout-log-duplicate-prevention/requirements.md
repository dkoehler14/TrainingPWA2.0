# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LogWorkout component currently has critical issues with workout data persistence that result in duplicate database entries, inefficient caching, and potential data loss. The system creates new workout log entries on every autosave instead of updating existing ones, leading to database bloat and inconsistent user experience. Additionally, the workout_log_exercises handling uses a destructive delete-and-recreate approach that is inefficient and prone to race conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user logging a workout, I want my workout data to be saved to a single workout log entry that gets updated as I make changes, so that I don't create duplicate entries in the database and my workout history remains clean and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes to workout data THEN the system SHALL check for an existing workout log ID using a reliable cache-first approach
2. WHEN an existing workout log ID is found in cache or database THEN the system SHALL update that existing log instead of creating a new one
3. WHEN no existing workout log is found THEN the system SHALL create a new workout log and immediately cache the ID for future updates
4. WHEN a workout log is created or updated THEN the system SHALL store the workout log ID in local state and persist it across component re-renders
5. WHEN multiple rapid saves occur THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions by using the cached ID consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the workout log caching mechanism to work reliably and efficiently so that my workout data is saved quickly without unnecessary database operations or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workout log is created THEN the system SHALL immediately cache the workout log ID in programLogs state with proper validation
2. WHEN checking for existing workout logs THEN the system SHALL first check the cached programLogs before querying the database
3. WHEN a cached workout log ID exists and is valid THEN the system SHALL use it for update operations without additional database queries
4. WHEN the cache is empty, invalid, or stale THEN the system SHALL query the database, update the cache, and use the result
5. WHEN cache validation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to database queries and update the cache accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workout exercise data to be updated efficiently without losing information, so that I can trust the system to preserve my workout progress accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workout exercises are updated THEN the system SHALL use upsert operations instead of delete-and-recreate
2. WHEN exercise data changes THEN the system SHALL only update the specific exercises that have changed
3. WHEN new exercises are added THEN the system SHALL insert them without affecting existing exercise data
4. WHEN exercises are removed THEN the system SHALL delete only the specific exercises that were removed
5. WHEN exercise updates fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide clear error feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to prevent duplicate workout logs at the database level, so that even if application logic fails, I won't have corrupted workout history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is updated THEN it SHALL include a unique constraint on (user_id, program_id, week_index, day_index)
2. WHEN duplicate workout logs are attempted to be created THEN the database SHALL reject the operation with a constraint violation
3. WHEN constraint violations occur THEN the application SHALL handle them gracefully and attempt to update the existing record
4. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL log the incident and provide user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for workout log operations so that I can debug issues, monitor system health, and ensure data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workout log operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including operation type, context, and stack traces
2. WHEN cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL log cache hits, misses, and validation results for debugging purposes
3. WHEN workout log IDs are retrieved, stored, or validated THEN the system SHALL log the operation with relevant metadata
4. WHEN duplicate prevention logic executes THEN the system SHALL log the decision path taken (create vs update) with reasoning
5. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL log the constraint violation details and recovery actions taken
