# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Firestore-based cache warming service to use Supabase as the data source. The current cache warming service is still importing from `enhancedFirestoreCache` while the application has migrated to Supabase, creating a mismatch between the cache warming strategy and the actual database being used. This migration will ensure optimal performance, cost efficiency, and user experience by properly warming the Supabase cache with relevant data based on user behavior patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want the app to load quickly when I navigate between different sections, so that I can efficiently log workouts and track progress without waiting for data to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN the system SHALL warm the Supabase cache with global exercise data within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL warm their personal cache with recent workout data, programs, and exercises within 3 seconds
3. WHEN cache warming completes THEN subsequent page loads SHALL be 70% faster than cold database queries
4. WHEN cache warming fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
5. WHEN cache warming is in progress THEN the system SHALL not initiate duplicate warming requests for the same user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want the app to intelligently predict what data I'll need based on my usage patterns, so that the most relevant information is always readily available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's during typical workout hours (6-9 AM or 5-8 PM) THEN the system SHALL prioritize cache warming with high priority
2. WHEN a user visits workout-heavy pages (log-workout, progress-tracker, programs) THEN the system SHALL trigger progressive cache warming
3. WHEN a user's last visited page was workout-related THEN the system SHALL warm workout-specific data with high priority
4. WHEN it's a typical workout day (Monday-Friday) THEN the system SHALL increase cache warming priority
5. WHEN user behavior patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL adjust warming strategies accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor cache warming performance and effectiveness, so that I can optimize the system and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache warming operations occur THEN the system SHALL record timing, success/failure, and metadata
2. WHEN cache warming completes THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on hit rates, performance improvements, and cost savings
3. WHEN cache warming fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
4. WHEN maintenance is performed THEN the system SHALL clean up old warming history and optimize cache usage
5. WHEN cache hit rates drop below 70% THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger additional warming

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want the cache warming to happen in the background without affecting my app experience, so that I can use the app normally while it optimizes performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache warming is active THEN the system SHALL not block user interactions or page navigation
2. WHEN multiple warming requests are queued THEN the system SHALL process them based on priority (high, normal, low)
3. WHEN cache warming encounters errors THEN the system SHALL continue normal app functionality
4. WHEN cache warming is scheduled THEN the system SHALL run maintenance every 15 minutes automatically
5. WHEN the app is closed or refreshed THEN the system SHALL gracefully stop warming operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cache warming service to integrate seamlessly with the existing Supabase cache infrastructure, so that I can maintain consistent caching patterns across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service initializes THEN it SHALL use the existing Supabase cache functions (warmUserCache, warmAppCache)
2. WHEN warming data THEN the system SHALL respect existing TTL configurations and cache invalidation patterns
3. WHEN integrating with existing code THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API interface as the current cache warming service
4. WHEN cache operations occur THEN the system SHALL work with existing cache statistics and monitoring
5. WHEN the service is imported THEN it SHALL be a drop-in replacement for the current cacheWarmingService

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want the system to optimize database costs by reducing redundant queries, so that the app remains cost-effective and sustainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache warming occurs THEN the system SHALL track and report estimated cost savings from reduced Supabase reads
2. WHEN warming strategies are applied THEN the system SHALL prioritize data that provides the highest cache hit rates
3. WHEN cache is warmed THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 60% read reduction rate compared to cold queries
4. WHEN cost analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL provide projected monthly savings from cache optimization
5. WHEN warming completes THEN the system SHALL demonstrate measurable bandwidth savings through cached responses
