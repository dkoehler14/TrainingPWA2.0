# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where editing an existing program and adding/removing weeks correctly updates the program's duration in the database, but fails to create or remove the corresponding program_workouts entries for the new/removed weeks. This creates data inconsistency where the program structure doesn't match the actual workout data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user editing an existing program, I want to add weeks to my program so that the new weeks have the same workout structure as existing weeks and are properly saved to the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a week to an existing program THEN the system SHALL create new program_workouts entries for each day in the new week
2. WHEN creating new program_workouts for added weeks THEN the system SHALL copy the exercise structure from the first week as the template
3. WHEN saving the program with added weeks THEN the system SHALL update both the programs table duration field AND create corresponding program_workouts entries
4. WHEN the save operation completes THEN all weeks SHALL have matching program_workouts entries in the database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user editing an existing program, I want to remove weeks from my program so that the corresponding workout data is properly cleaned up from the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user removes a week from an existing program THEN the system SHALL delete the corresponding program_workouts entries for that week
2. WHEN removing weeks THEN the system SHALL prevent removal of the last remaining week
3. WHEN saving the program with removed weeks THEN the system SHALL update both the programs table duration field AND remove corresponding program_workouts entries
4. WHEN the save operation completes THEN no orphaned program_workouts entries SHALL exist for the removed weeks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user editing an existing program, I want the week management operations to be atomic so that partial failures don't leave my program in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving program changes that include week additions/removals THEN the system SHALL perform all database operations within a transaction
2. IF any part of the week management operation fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a rollback occurs THEN the program SHALL remain in its original state before the edit attempt
4. WHEN the transaction succeeds THEN all related tables SHALL be updated consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user editing an existing program, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully so that I can reliably manage my program structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing a program with missing or corrupted program_workouts data THEN the system SHALL detect and repair the inconsistencies
2. WHEN adding weeks to a program with incomplete workout data THEN the system SHALL create complete workout structures for all weeks
3. WHEN the system detects data inconsistencies THEN it SHALL log the issues and attempt automatic repair
4. IF automatic repair is not possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages explaining the issue and suggested actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the week management functionality to be properly tested so that regressions can be prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the week management feature is implemented THEN it SHALL include unit tests for all core functions
2. WHEN testing week additions THEN the tests SHALL verify both database updates and data consistency
3. WHEN testing week removals THEN the tests SHALL verify proper cleanup and constraint handling
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the tests SHALL verify proper rollback behavior and error messaging
