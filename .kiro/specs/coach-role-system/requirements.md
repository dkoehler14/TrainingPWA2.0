# Coach Role System Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a hierarchical coach role system in the Exercise Tracker application. The system will enable fitness professionals to manage multiple clients, view their workout data, create personalized programs, and provide coaching insights. This builds upon the existing Supabase-based architecture with user roles already supporting 'user' and 'admin' roles.

The coach role system will transform the platform from an individual fitness tracking app into a comprehensive coaching platform, enabling new revenue streams and enhanced user engagement through personalized coaching relationships.
