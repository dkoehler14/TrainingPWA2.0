# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the data transformation process during Firestore to Supabase migration by adding comprehensive validation for workout_log_exercises data. The current data transformer lacks specific validation for workout exercise data integrity, which can lead to inconsistent or invalid data being imported into the PostgreSQL database. This enhancement ensures that all workout log exercise data meets strict validation criteria before being inserted into the database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate workout log exercise reps data, so that only valid rep counts are stored in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transforming workout log exercises THEN the system SHALL validate that all reps are either positive integers or null
2. WHEN a rep value is zero or negative THEN the system SHALL convert it to null
3. WHEN a rep value is not a number THEN the system SHALL convert it to null and log a warning
4. IF all reps in an exercise are invalid THEN the system SHALL convert all reps to null and log a warning
5. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL report the number of rep validation issues found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure array length consistency, so that reps and weights arrays match the sets count for each exercise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transforming workout log exercises THEN the system SHALL validate that reps array length equals the sets number
2. WHEN transforming workout log exercises THEN the system SHALL validate that weights array length equals the sets number
3. WHEN transforming workout log exercises THEN the system SHALL validate that completed array length equals the sets number
4. IF array lengths don't match sets THEN the system SHALL pad reps arrays with null values and weights arrays with 0 or truncate to match sets
5. WHEN array length mismatches are corrected THEN the system SHALL log a warning with details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate weight data integrity, so that only valid weight values are stored in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transforming workout log exercises THEN the system SHALL validate that all weights are either positive numbers or 0
3. WHEN a weight value is not a number THEN the system SHALL convert it to 0 and log a warning
4. IF bodyweight is provided THEN it SHALL be a positive decimal value or null
5. WHEN weight validation completes THEN the system SHALL report the number of weight validation issues found

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation reporting, so that I can identify and address data quality issues during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL track the number of validation corrections made
2. WHEN validation issues are found THEN the system SHALL log detailed warnings with exercise IDs and specific issues
3. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL include validation statistics in the transformation report
4. IF critical validation failures occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and stop processing
5. WHEN validation warnings are generated THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (reps, weights, arrays, etc.)
