# Programs Data Fetching Optimization - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Currently, the Programs page makes two separate database calls to fetch user programs - one for regular programs (`isTemplate: false`) and another for template programs (`isTemplate: true`). This approach is inefficient and may be contributing to data loading issues. This optimization will consolidate these calls into a single database query and filter the results client-side.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single Database Query

**User Story:** As a user loading the Programs page, I want the application to make fewer database calls so that the page loads faster and more reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Programs page loads THEN the system SHALL make only one database call to fetch all programs for the user
2. WHEN fetching programs THEN the system SHALL retrieve both template and non-template programs in a single query
3. WHEN the database query completes THEN the system SHALL filter the results client-side to separate templates from regular programs

### Requirement 2: Maintain Current Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Programs page to continue working exactly as before so that the optimization doesn't break existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display regular programs in the "Your Programs" section
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display template programs in the "Template Programs" section
3. WHEN programs are processed THEN the system SHALL apply the same error handling and validation as before
4. WHEN programs are cached THEN the system SHALL maintain the same caching behavior for performance

### Requirement 3: Performance Improvement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Programs page to load faster so that I can access my workout programs more quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the optimization is implemented THEN the system SHALL reduce the number of database queries from 2 to 1
2. WHEN programs are fetched THEN the total loading time SHALL be reduced compared to the current implementation
3. WHEN the cache is populated THEN the system SHALL cache all programs together to improve subsequent loads

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent error handling so that if there's an issue loading programs, I get clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the single database query fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages for both program sections
2. WHEN some programs have data issues THEN the system SHALL still display valid programs and show warnings for problematic ones
3. WHEN the query succeeds but returns no data THEN the system SHALL handle empty states appropriately for both sections

### Requirement 5: Cache Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the caching strategy to be optimized so that we don't duplicate cached data unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN programs are fetched THEN the system SHALL use a single cache entry for all user programs
2. WHEN the cache is invalidated THEN the system SHALL invalidate the unified cache entry
3. WHEN programs are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain cache consistency across the application

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the service interface to remain compatible so that other parts of the application continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other components call getUserPrograms with filters THEN the service SHALL continue to work as expected
2. WHEN the service is called with `isTemplate: false` THEN it SHALL return only non-template programs
3. WHEN the service is called with `isTemplate: true` THEN it SHALL return only template programs
4. WHEN the service is called without template filters THEN it SHALL return all programs
