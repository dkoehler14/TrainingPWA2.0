# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the exercise tracker application from Firebase/Firestore to Supabase, transitioning from a NoSQL document database to a PostgreSQL relational database with edge functions. The migration addresses the need for better relational data handling, improved query capabilities, and more cost-effective scaling as the application grows.

The current application uses Firebase Authentication, Firestore for data storage, and Firebase Functions for server-side logic. The migration will move to Supabase Auth, PostgreSQL database, and Supabase Edge Functions while maintaining all existing functionality and improving data relationships.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Firestore to PostgreSQL, so that I can leverage relational database capabilities for better data integrity and complex queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL as the primary database
2. WHEN data relationships are established THEN the system SHALL enforce referential integrity through foreign keys
3. WHEN complex queries are needed THEN the system SHALL support SQL joins and advanced query operations
4. WHEN the database schema is designed THEN it SHALL normalize data to reduce redundancy and improve consistency
5. IF data migration occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing user data without loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless authentication migration, so that I can continue accessing my account without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate through Supabase Auth
2. WHEN existing users migrate THEN their authentication credentials SHALL be preserved or migrated
3. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user experience as before
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN they SHALL work consistently across the application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Firebase Functions with Supabase Edge Functions, so that I can maintain server-side logic in the new architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN server-side operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Edge Functions
2. WHEN existing Firebase Functions are migrated THEN they SHALL maintain the same functionality
3. WHEN Edge Functions execute THEN they SHALL have access to the PostgreSQL database
4. IF functions need to be triggered THEN the system SHALL support database triggers and HTTP endpoints
5. WHEN functions are deployed THEN they SHALL be accessible from the client application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate all data access patterns, so that the application continues to work with the new database structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is queried THEN the system SHALL use Supabase client instead of Firestore SDK
2. WHEN CRUD operations occur THEN they SHALL work with PostgreSQL tables instead of Firestore collections
3. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL use Supabase real-time subscriptions
4. IF caching is implemented THEN it SHALL work with the new data access patterns
5. WHEN data validation occurs THEN it SHALL enforce PostgreSQL constraints and types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain application performance, so that users don't experience degradation after migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries execute THEN they SHALL perform at least as well as the current Firestore queries
2. WHEN caching is implemented THEN it SHALL reduce database load and improve response times
3. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL maintain current loading speeds or better
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and optimization tools
5. WHEN concurrent users access the system THEN it SHALL handle the load efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive data migration tooling, so that I can safely transfer all existing data to the new system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data migration runs THEN it SHALL transfer all user data from Firestore to PostgreSQL
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN it SHALL maintain data relationships and integrity
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN it SHALL provide verification that all data was transferred correctly
4. IF migration fails THEN it SHALL provide rollback capabilities and error reporting
5. WHEN migration runs THEN it SHALL handle large datasets efficiently without timeouts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated development and testing environments, so that I can develop and test with the new Supabase infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL use Supabase local development setup
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL work with the new database schema and Supabase client
3. WHEN seeding test data THEN it SHALL populate PostgreSQL tables instead of Firestore collections
4. IF development environment is set up THEN it SHALL include all necessary Supabase services
5. WHEN debugging occurs THEN it SHALL provide clear visibility into database operations and Edge Function execution

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper deployment and configuration management, so that the production migration can be executed safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use Supabase hosted services
2. WHEN configuration is managed THEN it SHALL support different environments (dev, staging, prod)
3. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL include database migrations and Edge Function deployments
4. IF rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL support reverting to the previous Firebase setup
5. WHEN monitoring is set up THEN it SHALL track database performance and Edge Function execution
