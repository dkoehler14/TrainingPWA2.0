# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the optimization of workout log save operations to reduce unnecessary database writes and improve performance. Currently, the system updates both the workout_logs table and workout_log_exercises table on every debounced save, even when only exercise data has changed. This creates unnecessary database load and potential for conflicts.

The goal is to implement a more efficient save strategy that only updates the workout_logs table when metadata actually changes (like workout completion) and focuses debounced saves on exercise data only.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Exercise-Only Save Operations

**User Story:** As a user logging my workout, I want my exercise data (reps, weights, completed sets) to be saved efficiently without unnecessary database overhead, so that the app remains responsive and doesn't create data conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes exercise data (reps, weights, completed status) THEN the system SHALL only update the workout_log_exercises table
2. WHEN exercise data is saved via debounced save THEN the system SHALL NOT update the workout_logs table unless metadata has changed
3. WHEN multiple rapid exercise changes occur THEN the system SHALL batch exercise updates efficiently
4. IF no workout_log exists THEN the system SHALL create a minimal workout_log entry with default metadata
5. WHEN exercise data is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL update the local cache with the latest exercise state

### Requirement 2: Metadata-Driven Workout Log Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want workout metadata (completion status, duration, notes) to be updated only when I explicitly change these values, so that unnecessary database writes are avoided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user finishes a workout THEN the system SHALL update the workout_logs table with completion metadata
2. WHEN a user adds workout notes THEN the system SHALL update the workout_logs table immediately
3. WHEN a user changes workout duration THEN the system SHALL update the workout_logs table
4. WHEN only exercise data changes THEN the system SHALL NOT update workout_logs metadata fields
5. IF workout metadata changes THEN the system SHALL use immediate save rather than debounced save

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Save Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the save system to intelligently determine what data has changed, so that only necessary database operations are performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining save strategy THEN the system SHALL differentiate between exercise data changes and metadata changes
2. WHEN exercise data changes THEN the system SHALL use exercise-only save operations
3. WHEN metadata changes THEN the system SHALL use full workout log save operations
4. WHEN both exercise and metadata change THEN the system SHALL update both tables in a single transaction
5. IF save operation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate strategy based on change type

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the new save strategy to work seamlessly with existing data and code, so that no data is lost and existing functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new save strategy THEN existing workout logs SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN migrating save operations THEN all existing API contracts SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN new save strategy is active THEN existing cache management SHALL continue to work
4. IF new save strategy encounters errors THEN the system SHALL fall back to existing save behavior
5. WHEN testing new strategy THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass

### Requirement 5: Performance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the performance improvements from the optimized save strategy, so that I can verify the optimization is working as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new save strategy is implemented THEN database write operations SHALL be reduced by at least 50% for exercise-only changes
2. WHEN monitoring save operations THEN the system SHALL log the type of save operation performed
3. WHEN measuring performance THEN response times for exercise updates SHALL improve
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL track exercise-only vs metadata save ratios
