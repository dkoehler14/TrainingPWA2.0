# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature consolidates the Programs and Workout History navigation items into a single unified page to reduce navigation clutter and improve user experience. The consolidated page will use a header dropdown to switch between "Programs" (default view showing current Programs page content) and "Quick Workouts" (showing current Workout History page content).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access both Programs and Quick Workouts from a single navigation item, so that the navigation bar is less cluttered and more organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the consolidated navigation item THEN the system SHALL display the Programs view by default
2. WHEN the user is on the consolidated page THEN the system SHALL show a prominent header dropdown with "Programs" and "Quick Workouts" options

4. WHEN the user selects "Quick Workouts" from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL display the current Workout History page content
5. WHEN the user navigates to the consolidated page THEN the system SHALL default to the "Programs" view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly switch between Programs and Quick Workouts views without losing context, so that I can efficiently manage both my structured programs and quick workout history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches between dropdown options THEN the system SHALL maintain the page state without full page reload
2. WHEN the user switches views THEN the system SHALL preserve any filters or search states within each view
3. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL remember the last selected view option
4. WHEN the user bookmarks or shares a URL THEN the system SHALL support direct navigation to either Programs or Quick Workouts view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the consolidated page to maintain all existing functionality from both original pages, so that no features are lost during the consolidation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Programs section THEN the system SHALL display all current Programs page functionality including create, edit, delete, and view operations
2. WHEN viewing the Quick Workouts section THEN the system SHALL display all current Workout History functionality including filtering, sorting, and workout details
3. WHEN performing actions in either view THEN the system SHALL maintain the same performance and responsiveness as the original pages
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure the dropdown and both views are fully responsive and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual indication of which view I'm currently in, so that I always know whether I'm looking at Programs or Quick Workouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on either view THEN the system SHALL clearly highlight the active dropdown option
2. WHEN the user switches views THEN the system SHALL update the page title and any breadcrumbs to reflect the current view
