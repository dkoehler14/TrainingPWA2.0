# Design Document

## Overview

This design consolidates the Programs and Quick Workout History pages into a single unified page with a header dropdown to switch between views. The solution maintains all existing functionality while reducing navigation clutter and improving user experience through a more organized interface.

## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
ProgramsWorkoutHub (New consolidated page)
├── ViewSelector (Header dropdown component)
├── ProgramsView (Existing Programs page content)
└── QuickWorkoutsView (Existing QuickWorkoutHistory page content)
```

### Navigation Flow

1. **Current State**: Separate navigation items for "Programs" and "Workout History"
2. **New State**: Single navigation item "Programs" that leads to consolidated page
3. **Default View**: Programs view loads by default
4. **View Switching**: Header dropdown allows switching between "Programs" and "Quick Workouts"

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. ProgramsWorkoutHub (Main Container)

**Location**: `src/pages/ProgramsWorkoutHub.js`

**Responsibilities**:
- Manage active view state (Programs vs Quick Workouts)
- Handle URL routing for direct navigation to specific views
- Coordinate shared state between views if needed
- Provide consistent layout and styling

**Props**:
- `userRole`: User role for permission-based features

**State**:
```javascript
{
  activeView: 'programs' | 'quick-workouts',
  // Any shared state between views
}
```

### 2. ViewSelector (Header Dropdown)

**Location**: `src/components/ViewSelector.js`

**Responsibilities**:
- Display current active view
- Provide dropdown interface for view switching
- Handle view change events
- Support keyboard navigation and accessibility

**Props**:
```javascript
{
  activeView: string,
  onViewChange: (view: string) => void,
  options: Array<{value: string, label: string}>
}
```

### 3. ProgramsView (Wrapper Component)

**Location**: `src/components/ProgramsView.js`

**Responsibilities**:
- Wrap existing Programs page component
- Handle any view-specific state management
- Maintain all current Programs functionality

**Implementation**: Direct import and rendering of existing `Programs` component

### 4. QuickWorkoutsView (Wrapper Component)

**Location**: `src/components/QuickWorkoutsView.js`

**Responsibilities**:
- Wrap existing QuickWorkoutHistory page component
- Handle any view-specific state management
- Maintain all current QuickWorkoutHistory functionality

**Implementation**: Direct import and rendering of existing `QuickWorkoutHistory` component

## Data Models

### URL Structure

**Current URLs**:
- `/programs` - Programs page
- `/quick-workout-history` - Workout History page

**New URLs**:
- `/programs` - Consolidated page (Programs view by default)
- `/programs?view=programs` - Programs view (explicit)
- `/programs?view=quick-workouts` - Quick Workouts view

### View State Model

```javascript
const viewConfig = {
  programs: {
    label: 'Programs',
    component: ProgramsView,
    defaultRoute: '/programs'
  },
  'quick-workouts': {
    label: 'Quick Workouts', 
    component: QuickWorkoutsView,
    defaultRoute: '/programs?view=quick-workouts'
  }
};
```

## Error Handling

### View Loading Errors
- Graceful fallback to Programs view if invalid view specified
- Error boundaries around each view component
- User-friendly error messages for failed view switches

### Navigation Errors
- Handle invalid URL parameters gracefully
- Maintain browser history correctly during view switches
- Preserve deep linking functionality

### State Management Errors
- Isolated error handling for each view
- Prevent errors in one view from affecting the other
- Maintain view state during error recovery

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- ViewSelector component behavior and accessibility
- ProgramsWorkoutHub state management
- URL parameter parsing and routing logic
- View switching functionality

### Integration Tests
- Navigation flow between views
- URL synchronization with view state
- Browser history management
- Deep linking to specific views

### User Acceptance Tests
- Complete Programs functionality in new context
- Complete QuickWorkoutHistory functionality in new context
- Smooth view switching experience
- Mobile responsiveness of consolidated interface

### Performance Tests
- View switching performance (should be instant)
- Memory usage when switching between views
- Initial load time comparison with separate pages

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create ProgramsWorkoutHub container component
2. Create ViewSelector dropdown component
3. Implement basic view switching logic
4. Set up URL routing with query parameters

### Phase 2: View Integration
1. Create ProgramsView wrapper component
2. Create QuickWorkoutsView wrapper component
3. Integrate existing page components
4. Test functionality preservation

### Phase 3: Navigation Updates
1. Update NavBar to point to consolidated page
2. Remove separate "Workout History" navigation item
3. Update App.js routing configuration
4. Handle redirect from old URLs

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing
1. Add loading states during view switches
2. Implement accessibility features
3. Add responsive design optimizations
4. Comprehensive testing and bug fixes

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load view components to reduce initial bundle size
- Implement view caching to prevent re-mounting on switches
- Optimize shared data fetching between views

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for dropdown and view switching
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader announcements for view changes
- Focus management during view transitions

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Responsive dropdown design for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly view switching interface
- Optimized layout for smaller screens
- Consistent mobile experience across views

### Browser Compatibility
- URL parameter handling across browsers
- History API usage for proper back/forward behavior
- Fallback for browsers without modern features

## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility
- Redirect `/quick-workout-history` to `/programs?view=quick-workouts`
- Maintain existing bookmarks and shared links
- Gradual rollout with feature flags if needed

### Data Preservation
- No data migration required (views use same data sources)
- Maintain existing caching strategies
- Preserve user preferences and filters within views

### Rollback Plan
- Keep original page components intact during transition
- Feature flag to switch between old and new navigation
- Quick rollback capability if issues arise
