# Migration Orchestrator

The Migration Orchestrator is the main entry point for the complete Firestore to Supabase migration process. It coordinates all migration tools and provides a unified workflow with comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and recovery capabilities.

## Overview

The Migration Orchestrator serves as the central coordination system that:

- **Orchestrates the entire migration pipeline** from start to finish
- **Integrates all migration tools** into a unified workflow
- **Provides comprehensive error handling** and recovery procedures
- **Offers real-time monitoring** and progress tracking
- **Enables flexible execution** with various modes and options
- **Ensures data integrity** through automated verification and rollback

## Migration Pipeline

The orchestrator executes the migration in six distinct phases:

### 1. Pre-validation Phase
- Validates database connections (Firestore and Supabase)
- Checks migration prerequisites and system requirements
- Validates configuration and required parameters
- Ensures sufficient disk space and permissions

### 2. Extraction Phase
- Extracts all data from Firestore collections
- Handles large datasets with batching and progress tracking
- Implements data validation during extraction
- Creates extraction reports and statistics

### 3. Transformation Phase
- Transforms Firestore documents to PostgreSQL-compatible format
- Handles data type conversions and relationship mapping
- Performs data cleaning and normalization
- Resolves foreign key relationships

### 4. Import Phase
- Imports transformed data into PostgreSQL/Supabase
- Uses batch processing with transaction management
- Establishes foreign key relationships
- Provides progress tracking and error recovery

### 5. Verification Phase
- Runs comprehensive data integrity verification
- Compares Firestore and PostgreSQL data
- Validates relationships and constraints
- Performs optional performance testing

### 6. Post-migration Phase
- Cleans up temporary files
- Generates comprehensive migration reports
- Updates application configuration (if needed)
- Provides final status and next steps

#### Verification Errors
- **Common issues**: Data integrity failures, count mismatches, relationship violations
- **Recovery**: Automatic rollback may be initiated based on configuration
- **Impact**: Data imported but verification failed, rollback available

### Checkpoint and Resume System

The orchestrator saves checkpoints after each successful phase:

```json
{
  "migrationId": "migration-2024-01-15T10-30-00-123Z-abc123",
  "lastCompletedPhase": "transformation",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:35:00.000Z",
  "migrationState": {
    "currentPhase": "transformation",
    "overallStatus": "in_progress",
    "results": {
      "pre_validation": { "connectionsValid": true },
      "extraction": { "totalRecords": 1000 },
      "transformation": { "transformedRecords": 995 }
    }
  }
}
```

To resume from a checkpoint:
```bash
node scripts/migration/migration-orchestrator.js --resume --checkpoint-file ./migration-checkpoint.json
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Stop
Safely stops the current migration and saves state:
```bash
node scripts/migration/migration-orchestrator.js --emergency-stop
```

#### Emergency Rollback
Immediately initiates rollback procedures:
```bash
node scripts/migration/migration-orchestrator.js --emergency-rollback
```

## Best Practices

### Before Migration
1. **Test thoroughly** - Run test migrations in development environment
2. **Validate configuration** - Ensure all credentials and settings are correct
3. **Create backups** - Backup both Firestore and PostgreSQL data
4. **Plan downtime** - Schedule migration during low-usage periods
5. **Monitor resources** - Ensure sufficient disk space and memory

### During Migration
1. **Monitor progress** - Watch real-time status updates
2. **Check logs** - Monitor log files for warnings or issues
3. **Avoid interruption** - Don't stop the process unless emergency
4. **Have rollback plan** - Be prepared to rollback if needed
5. **Monitor performance** - Watch system resource usage

### After Migration
1. **Review reports** - Thoroughly review all migration reports
2. **Verify data** - Manually spot-check critical data
3. **Test application** - Ensure application works with new database
4. **Monitor performance** - Watch application performance post-migration
5. **Clean up** - Remove temporary files when migration is confirmed successful

### Production Recommendations
- Use `comprehensive` verification level for production migrations
- Enable auto-rollback for safety (`--auto-rollback` is default)
- Use appropriate batch sizes based on system capacity
- Run during maintenance windows
- Have database administrator available during migration
- Test the complete process in staging environment first

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Errors
```
Error: Failed to connect to Supabase: Invalid API key
```
**Solution**: Verify Supabase URL and service role key are correct

#### Permission Errors
```
Error: Insufficient permissions to read Firestore collection
```
**Solution**: Ensure Firebase service account has proper read permissions

#### Memory Issues
```
Error: JavaScript heap out of memory
```
**Solution**: Reduce batch size or increase Node.js memory limit

#### Disk Space Issues
```
Error: ENOSPC: no space left on device
```
**Solution**: Free up disk space or use different working directory

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging for detailed troubleshooting:
```bash
node scripts/migration/migration-orchestrator.js --verbose --dry-run
```

### Log Analysis
Check specific log files for detailed error information:
- `migration-log.json` - Detailed operation logs
- `migration-status.json` - Current status and errors
- Individual tool logs in working directory

## Environment Variables

The orchestrator supports these environment variables:

```bash
# Required
export SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"

# Optional
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/firebase-service-account.json"
export MIGRATION_WORKING_DIR="./custom-workspace"
export MIGRATION_BATCH_SIZE="50"
```

## Security Considerations

### Credentials Management
- Store service role keys securely
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate keys after migration completion
- Limit service account permissions to minimum required

### Data Protection
- Backup files contain sensitive data
- Use secure storage for backup files
- Implement proper access controls
- Clean up temporary files after migration

### Network Security
- Use secure connections (HTTPS/TLS)
- Consider VPN for database connections
- Monitor network traffic during migration
- Implement proper firewall rules

## Performance Optimization

### Batch Size Tuning
- Start with default batch size (100)
- Increase for better performance with sufficient resources
- Decrease if experiencing memory issues
- Monitor system resources during migration

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: Minimum 4GB RAM, recommended 8GB+
- **Disk**: 2x source data size for temporary files
- **Network**: Stable, high-bandwidth connection
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for parallel processing

### Optimization Tips
- Run during off-peak hours
- Use SSD storage for working directory
- Ensure stable network connection
- Monitor and adjust batch sizes based on performance
- Consider running verification separately for large datasets
